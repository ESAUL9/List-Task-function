The program implements an array of 10 tasks

The user is them supposed to pick from these tasks to add on to their todo list. 


There is a restriction of 4 tasks so the user won't be overwhelmed. 

The program also iterates through recursive functions based on what the user presses.


There are add/delete functions as well as search for keywords, and list functions all coded by  Justice.  


Program should run without bugs.
